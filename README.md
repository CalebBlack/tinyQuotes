Hey, I'm Paulo Nunes and here you have the repo of tinyQuotes.
tinyQuotes is a website where you can explore, love and share quotes with others on twitter or tumblr. Here on tinyQuotes HQ we make sure you have a lovely experience with our website and so we try with our hearts to keep things easy and attractive with our unique, minimal and fresh design. We make sure you find what you like and share it when possible.

##Why?
tinyQuotes idea comes from a lack of creativity and originality on quote related websites which focus on staying on top and we don't really like that so we focus mainly on our visitor experience, highlighting what is important and keeping white space so you don't get lost and bored. We maintain what's important at the front and, most important, we don't advertise just because we feel it's annoying(if we did advertise you would block them :p).

##how?
We focus our minimal design in a combination of formality and user-friendly design. We make things serious but we also keep them funny(only true quoters can spot them AHAA!)

##What?
We offer you a gooood range of quotes to explore, love and share with others with only a *click*. We also offer two language versions(spanish and english), we add quotes weekly and make sure they have a core meaning, and finally we offer you the posibility to send us your fav quotes. 



*No Database*, all happening *locally*. *Fast page load* and *no frameworks*, *pure* CSS and JS.
Send us your quotes at: amiguencio@icloud.com

Our Goal
=========
Offer a user friendly ecosystem.
Explore, love and share.
Improve our skills.
Make our internet better.
Be part of the 1% who creates beautiful content on internet.

**UPDATES**
==========
+ Fixed some bugs with loving quotes, made a major improvement and added a new feature letting you search tags. *some hidden features added... let's see if you spot them* :smiley:
+ Major bug found and getting ready to obliterate it with a code performance improvement.
+ Added tiny things to the UI and made it easier to see the Favs Center(click on "Favoritas" to show it). Fixed tiny bugs and added shortcuts info.
+ Added feature letting you see all your favourite quotes, the only thing you have to do is put #fav at the end of the URL and enjoy:) Also included option that redirects to the quote if you click the author on #fav mode.
+ UnLove a quote will not be added because I think if you like a quote you will like it for a long time and it is unnecessary to put an option you won't use. Also it can cause some trouble by double clicking it.
+ Fixed major bug causing double quote change and added a new div showing the total quotes you loved.
+ Added new feature letting you share the URL of the quote, search for it on "Tiny Quote" button.
+ Fixed bugs and Added some tiny elements for the user :')
+ Added a recovery option for the users who would like to add or change a new device and keep their favs on the new device.
Some minor bug fixes, CSS improvement and compatibility with all browsers.
+ Added a love ":heart:" button to add a quote as YOUR favourite. This quote will be stored on localStorage with the other quotes you loved or you are going to love :) . *Next update will let you un love a quote*.
+ Added developer favourite quote element right next to the author.(soon will be a star)
+ Added Social Links to share the quotes.


**Future Updates**
=========
+ When yo visit one of the two version languages the system will catch which one you choose and when you go to the main page you wil be redirected to your most visited version.
