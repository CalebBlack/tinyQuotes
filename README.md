Hipsterize
==========

A Quotes Page with contributions. *Beautiful* and *Minimal*.
Minimal single page website where a random quote is displayed. On every refresh it will show a random quote, maybe it can show the quote twice because you know... it is a RANDOM number and sometimes it can be the same in two tries.

You can send a quote with the author( not optional ) and add one of your social networks profile ( optional ) to be referred.

Send some feedback if you want to help and you will be reffered on about ( page able soon ) and here.
