Hipsterize
==========

A Quotes Page with contributions. *Beautiful* and *Minimal*.

Minimal single page website where a random quote is displayed. The quote can be shown twice because you know... it is a RANDOM number and sometimes can be the same in two tries or three.. BUT NOT FOUR :)

*No Database*, all happening *locally*. *Fast page load* and *no frameworks*, *pure* CSS and JS.

You can send a quote with the author( not optional ) and add one of your social networks profile ( optional ) to be referred.

Send some feedback if you want to help and you will be reffered on about ( page able soon ) and here.

**UPDATES**
==========
+ Major bug found and getting ready to obliterate it with a code performance improvement.
+ Added tiny things to the UI and made it easier to see the Favs Center(click on "Favoritas" to show it). Fixed tiny bugs and added shortcuts info.
+ Added feature letting you see all your favourite quotes, the only thing you have to do is put #fav at the end of the URL and enjoy:) Also included option that redirects to the quote if you click the author on #fav mode.
+ UnLove a quote will not be added because I think if you like a quote you will like it for a long time and it is unnecessary to put an option you won't use. Also it can cause some trouble by double clicking it.
+ Fixed major bug causing double quote change and added a new div showing the total quotes you loved.
+ Added new feature letting you share the URL of the quote, search for it on "Tiny Quote" button.
+ Fixed bugs and Added some tiny elements for the user :')
+ Added a recovery option for the users who would like to add or change a new device and keep their favs on the new device.
Some minor bug fixes, CSS improvement and compatibility with all browsers.
+ Added a love ":heart:" button to add a quote as YOUR favourite. This quote will be stored on localStorage with the other quotes you loved or you are going to love :) . *Next update will let you un love a quote*.
+ Added developer favourite quote element right next to the author.(soon will be a star)
+ Added Social Links to share the quotes.


**Future Updates**
=========
+ Tag the quotes and search them easily.
+ When yo visit one of the two version languages the system will catch which one you choose and when you go to the main page you wil be redirected to your most visited version.
